# RESUME_APP_DIABETES-TRACKER
MediSync is a structured medical data platform that starts with diabetes because it is highly data-driven and requires continuous monitoring. The app analyzes reports, vitals, medications, and trends to build accurate health timelines, then expands modularly into other conditions using the same clinical data framework.
